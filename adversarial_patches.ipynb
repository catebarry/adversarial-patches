Given a model to fool, a target class to design the patch for, and a size $k$ of the patch in the number of pixels, we first start by creating a parameter of size $3\\times k\\times k$. These are the only parameters we will train, and the network itself remains untouched. We use a simple SGD optimizer with momentum to minimize the classification loss of the model given the patch in the image. While we first start with a very high loss due to the good initial performance of the network, the loss quickly decreases once we start changing the patch. In the end, the patch will represent patterns that are characteristic of the class. For instance, if we would want the model to predict a \"goldfish\" in every image, we would expect the pattern to look somewhat like a goldfish. Over the iterations, the model finetunes the pattern and, hopefully, achieves a high fooling accuracy."
